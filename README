HiSilicon Poplar Tools

This git repository contains code and documentation related to the
HiSilicon Poplar board.  The Poplar board uses a HiSilicon Hi3798cv200
quad core ARM Cortex A53 processor, supporting NEON and multi-core
Mali T720 GPU, and able to decode 4K UHD data streams at 60 fps.
The Poplar board has 1GB of RAM; about 8GB or eMMC; an Ethernet
port; an HDMI 2.0a port supporting HDCP 2.2; and other support
including WiFi, Bluetooth, and IR.

The following git repositories contain source code to use for
development with the Poplar board:

git@github.com:linaro/poplar-tools.git
	This repository contains tools related to building software
	for Poplar.  It also includes general development-related
	documentation on the Poplar source code.

git@github.com:linaro/poplar-linux.git
   	The Linux kernel, with additional support for Poplar that is
	not yet upstream.
	
git@github.com:linaro/poplar-u-boot.git
	The U-Boot boot loader with support for Poplar that is not
	yet upstream.

git@github.com:linaro/poplar-arm-trusted-firmware.git
	ARM Trusted Firmware, with support for Poplar that is not
	yet upstream.

git@github.com:linaro/poplar-l-loader.git
	An initial stage boot loader used by Poplar.  Its primary
	purpose is to switch the CPU from operating in 32-bit mode
	to 64-bit mode before launching ARM Trusted Firmware.

The file "build_instructions.txt" here describes how to build the
code listed above, and how to package the result into a form that
can be used to perform an initial (or recovery) flash of the code
onto the Poplar board's eMMC storage.
